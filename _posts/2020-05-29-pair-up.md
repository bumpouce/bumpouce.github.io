    <h3>About</h3>

    <br><h3>Plan</h3>
    <p>This project was created by a team of three, including myself.  One member was largely responsible for the back-end, another for the general site layout and leaderboards, and finally, I was in charge of game play.  We all worked together on all the pieces, but those were our primary responsibilities.  My biggest challenges were: randomly choosing and distributing the proper number of tiles, timing the game so it was slow enough to see but fast enough to not fall behind the player's speed, and integrating the timing system.</p>
