I"8<p>This weekend, I’ve started learning about Jekyll on Github to create my portfolio site. So far, there are a lot of helpful tutorials to follow, and I’m starting to gain some context for the structure. 
I hope I can turn it into something that helps me to organize and demonstrate my learning journey!</p>
