  Why do we code?  What is the purpose of a computer?  We have all seen the changes in the role of technology in our everyday lives, particularly in the past 10 years.  To me, the important thing about technology is how it improves our abilities to communicate, relate to others and care for others.  Technology should improve our everyday lives - making it easier to safely share important information, keep in touch with people far away, learn and grow.

  Although I was exposed to computers from an early age (think text-based adventure games on a DOS command line!), I started out my tech journey in earnest by pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.  I studied Pascal, C++, computer networks, digital electronics, Assembly language, data structures, algorithms, AI with LISP, Unix, and other programming related courses. I tutored Computer Science in the Academic Assistance Center, and worked for Computing & Telecommunications as a student worker, where I had the opportunity to be a part of a small group who rewired and added infrastructure to Pacific Lutheran University's residence halls to support internet connectivity in the late '90s, and with the same group wrote the software (using Perl) to create and manage the university's VLAN system.

  After graduating, I worked for AT&T Wireless as they separated from AT&T, were later bought by Cingular Wireless, and then rebranded back to AT&T Wireless.  I worked in Software Performance Testing, ensuring that the company's billing software was able to load balance properly and maintain reliability expectations.  Later, I transfered into Automated Regression Testing, where we wrote JavaScript tests to business requirements to confirm that existing functionality was not impacted when updates were made. (JavaScript has come a long way since then!)

  I left AT&T Wireless after seven years to get to know the world more deeply, and spent the next seven years teaching English to speakers of other languages in Fukushima, Japan; Galapagos, Ecuador; and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  This time gave me the opportunity, not only to learn about other languages and cultures, but also to see how technology is used around the world!  When I returned to the US in 2014, I became an Emergency Medical Technician, and spent five years working in South Seattle, providing high-quality Basic Life Support care for all residents.

  My experiences have given me a unique perspective on the role of technology in our society, and awareness of different technology users who may have needs that are currently under-served by our design and developments strategies.  I have strong opinions about some technologies that are being leveraged to monetize the digital experience, but minimize and detract from the lived human experience.  My goal as a programmer is to create self-sustaining products that deepen our understanding of ourselves (like physical health, mental well-being, education opportunities), our relationships with our families and friends, and our connection to the world at large outside of our own in-groups.  Technology has the possibility to be a broad equalizer, bringing out the best in ourselves, and enhancing our potential, and that's what I want to be helping create in this field.
